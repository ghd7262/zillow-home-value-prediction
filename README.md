# zillow-home-value-prediction

# Build a model to predict Zillow's home value 

## Objective
The purpose of this project is to use linear models to predict Zillow's home value. I have also encorporated regularization methods to compare how models perform under different settings.

### Dataset
The data is from kaggle's Zillow Home value prediction competition. You can find more information from the link below:

### Methods Used
- Data Visualization
- Machine Learning: Linear Regression 
- Regularization: Lasso (L1) / Ridge (L2) / Elastic Net

### Technologies
- Python
- Numpy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Sklearn

## Project Description
The dataset is from Kaggle's Zillow Home value prediction competition. This project was to implement linear models and use regularization techniques to compare model performance.
